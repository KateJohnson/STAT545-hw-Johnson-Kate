# STAT 547 Homework 8

This is the folder for my Shiny app. My app helps the user choose which liquor to buy based on the type, price, and alcohol content.

This BC Liquour Store data was used to develop the app. 

My app is deployed online on Shinyapps.io [here](https://katejohnson.shinyapps.io/My_new_app/). 

You can also find my server and user interface code in this folder.
